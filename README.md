# Codechallenge1
This  is my repository for the first code challenge.
FIRST CODE CHALLENGE(GRADING, SPEED AND SALARY OPERATIONS).
This repository contains 8 files. One file is a README file, 4 are html files while 3 are JavaScript files which contain the actual solutions for the assignment. The file to be opened first is the index.html file from where you will be taken to the respective web pages where each solution will be observed.
