# Codechallenge1
This  is my(Andy MUnyiri) repository for my code challenge project for the first week of phase 1.
## Author
This project was created by Andy Munyiri. 
## Description
This repository contains 8 files. Out of the eight files, there are 4 html files, 3 JavaScript files and 1 readme file.The index.html file is the main file and is the starting file. It is linked to the other 3 html files which are linked to the three js files.
## Project Setup
The main webpage is the index.html file. This page is linked to three html files(grader.html, speeddetector.html and netsalary.html) whose target attributes are set to blank and thus open in diffferent windows. Each of the redirected wimdows have a input prompt with instructions that are to be read carefully and the required input to be entered. Once the needed data is presented the JavaScript functions automatically take the data process it and present the result as an alert message.
